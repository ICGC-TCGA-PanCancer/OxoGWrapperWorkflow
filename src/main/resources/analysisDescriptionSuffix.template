Note the 'ANALYSIS_TYPE' is 'REFERENCE_ASSEMBLY' but a better term to describe this analysis is 'SEQUENCE_VARIATION' as defined by the EGA's SRA 1.5 schema.
Please note the reference used for alignment was hs37d, see ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/reference/phase2_reference_assembly_sequence/README_human_reference_20110707 for more information.
Briefly this is the integrated reference sequence from the GRCh37 primary assembly (chromosomal plus unlocalized and unplaced contigs),
the rCRS mitochondrial sequence (AC:NC_012920), Human herpesvirus 4 type 1 (AC:NC_007605) and the concatenated decoy sequences (hs37d5cs.fa.gz).
Variant calls may not be present for all contigs in this reference.
