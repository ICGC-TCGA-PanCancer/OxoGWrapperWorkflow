# CHANGELOG

## 2.0.4
 - Fixes:
 	- In situations with multiple tumours, the merged VCFs did not contain data from all tumours, they were only the merge across pipelines of each tumour. This has been corrected: there will now be a single set of merged VCFs which are a merge-by-type across all pipelines across all tumours.
 	- Naming of call_stats and gnos_files in output followed incorrect naming convetion. This has been corrected.

## 2.0.3
 - Changes to the OxoG docker image from Dimitri. This is supposed to fix the OxoG MAF issues. New image name is "oxog:160428".

## 2.0.2
 - Bugfixes:
 	- for gtdownload:
 		- properly index the URLs
 		- use the correct key for downloading BAMs
 	- Remove possible "/datafiles/VCF/..." prefix from files_for_upload

## 2.0.1
 - VCFs can now be missing and the workflow will continue. To use this feature, add `allowMissingFiles=true` to your INI file.

## 2.0.0
 - OxoG can now handle donors with multiple tumours!

 **NOTE:** INI files generated by version 1.1.5 or earlier will NOT be compatible with this version of the workflow. Regenerate your INI files using the updated INI generator in this version of the workflow. INIs generated with this version are NOT compatible with *earlier* versions of the workflow.

## 1.1.5
 - Now use OxoG container "oxog:160329" which contains a new version of variantbam. This new version of variantbam fixes an issue where it was generating stats and encountered the value "-1" in the NM tag and failed.

## 1.1.4
 - Hotfix: Fixed a bug where the Sanger SNV index file was being referenced instead of the SV file. This was causing problems for Workers that used the S3 download method as two index files would get downloaded with the same name, and then the job that stats all files to ensure that they all exist would fail.
 

## 1.1.3
 - stat all files that have been downloaded - sometimes gtdownload will not download a file but the exit code is still 0 so we must `stat` the files to make sure they were actually downloaded properly.
 - gtdownload process now takes two keys: one for BAMs and once for VCFs. This is for situations where BAMs and VCFs are not hosted in the same place and require different keys for download.
 - fixes for git_mv script: updated file should now be committed instead of overwritten.

## 1.1.2
 - Fixes to git_mv script

## 1.1.1
 - Use version 1.0.13 of icgc-storage-client
 - Fix for issue with AWS credentials being clobbered by the launcher
 - Fix git_mv to set timestamps inside loop

## 1.1.0
 - Input files can now be downloaded using gtdownload or AWS CLI. To do this, add a new property to you INI file: downloadMethod.
This can have one of three options:
	- gtdownload
	- icgcStorageClient
	- s3 (You will need to put your AWS credentials in ~/.gnos on the launcher for this to work).
 - The timestamps of workflow state transitions will be injected in the JSON files before they are moved in github. They will look something like this: "transition_to_downloading-jobs_timestamp":"2016-03-18T15:00:00"
 - Workflow now uses icgc-storage-client version 1.0.12

## 1.0.4
 - Fixed a bug in git_move.py

## 1.0.3
 - Changed pre-processing to replace leading M with MT in the CHROM field. This was causing bcf-tools norm to fail.
	At least one Broad INDEL had M (which is not valid) instead of MT, so it will be fixed at workflow run-time. 
 
## 1.0.2
 - Fixed the git_move.py script to move files in git better.

## 1.0.1
**Main changes:**
 - Add `git reset --hard origin/master` to git move scripts.
 - Add `-t` and `-u` to rsync command, trying to resolve the manifest-newer-than-igto issue that Jonthan reported.

**Other changes:**
 - update ini_generator.sh script with more current default values.
 - Code cleanup in INI Generator.
 - Update Dockerfile (even though it's not used right now).
 - Update SeqWare artifact dependency to seqware-bin-linux-x86-64-jre-8.0.45
 
## 1.0.0
Initial release.
